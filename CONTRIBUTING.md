# Contributing to Hacktoberfest
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- If you are beginner then you can contribute by improving the structure or the layout or any mistakes in the repository.

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.
